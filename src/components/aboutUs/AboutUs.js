        Our story began in 2020 post covid where the need for AIaaS (AI as a
        Service) <br />
        was gaining traction in the tech industry. Realizing the importance of
        growing
        <br />
        demand in AI services and niched problems, we at Renix Informatics
        started to
        <br />
        form a decentralized team to work on various use cases in the AI domain.{" "}
        <br />
        We have always thrived to provide the best services to our clients. The
        team,
        <br />
        culture, framework and tools that we built are capable of solving
        challenging
        <br />
        business use cases and help customers to make smart decisions.
