        Our story began in 2020 post covid where the need for AIaaS (AI as a
        Service) <br/>was gaining traction in the tech industry. Realizing the
        importance of growing <br/>demand in AI services and niched problems, we at
        Renix Informatics started to <br/>form a decentralized team to work on
        various use cases in the AI domain. <br/>The team, culture, framework and
        tools that we built are capable of solving <br/>challenging business use
        cases and help customers to make smart decisions.
